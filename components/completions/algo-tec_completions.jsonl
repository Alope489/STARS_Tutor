Here's a general breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Divide**: The list is split into two halves. This step is recursively applied until each sublist contains a single element.\n2. **Conquer**: The two halves are merged together in a sorted order. During merging, you compare elements from both sublists and arrange them in order.\n3. **Combine**: This process is repeated recursively until the entire list is merged back into a sorted array.\n\nBy using recursion and merging the lists in sorted order, merge sort achieves a time complexity of O(n log n), making it very efficient for larger datasets."}]}

Its time complexity is consistently O(n log n), regardless of the input data, but it requires extra space for the temporary arrays used in merging.\n2. **Quick Sort**: It is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm but works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around this pivot, so that elements smaller than the pivot go to the left and elements greater go to the right. Quick sort’s worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), but on average, it performs better with O(n log n) and uses less space than merge sort, making it more efficient in practice.\n\nBoth have different advantages depending on the use case, with quicksort often being faster in practice despite its worst-case performance."}]}

It is typically used for optimization problems and is particularly useful when the problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\n\nThere are two main approaches to DP:\n1. **Top-down approach (Memoization)**: You solve the problem recursively but store the results of subproblems in a cache (or memo) to avoid recalculating them.\n2. **Bottom-up approach (Tabulation)**: You solve the problem iteratively and build up the solution to the entire problem from solutions to the smaller subproblems.\n\nDynamic programming is often applied in problems like the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and shortest path algorithms, and is a powerful way to optimize algorithms that would otherwise have exponential time complexity."}]}

In other words, it chooses the best option available at the moment without worrying about the consequences of that choice in the future.\n\nGreedy algorithms are typically used when a problem has the following two properties:\n1. **Greedy choice property**: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.\n2. **Optimal substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.\n\nSome classic examples of problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms include the coin change problem, Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree, and Huffman coding for data compression. However, it's important to note that greedy algorithms do not always produce the optimal solution for every problem; they are most effective in problems where the greedy strategy works to find the global optimum."}]}
