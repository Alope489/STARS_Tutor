{"input": "What is a tautology in propositional logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Can you explain what makes a formula a tautology?\nIntermediate answer: A tautology is a formula that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components. It holds true for every possible interpretation of its variables.\nFollow up: Can you provide an example of a tautological formula?\nSo the final answer is: An example of a tautology is the formula [(P → Q) ∧ P] → Q, which is always true for every value of its propositional variables."}
{"input": "What is the difference between a contradiction and a contingency in propositional logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Can you define a contradiction in propositional logic?\nIntermediate answer: A contradiction is a formula that is always false, no matter the truth values of its components. It can never be true.\nFollow up: What is an example of a contradiction?\nSo the final answer is: An example of a contradiction is the formula (P ∨ Q) ∧ [(¬P) ∧ (¬Q)], which is always false."}
{"input": "How do De Morgan's Laws apply to logical expressions?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What are De Morgan's Laws?\nIntermediate answer: De Morgan's Laws describe how negation distributes over conjunctions and disjunctions. They state that: \n1. ¬(P ∧ Q) = (¬P) ∨ (¬Q)\n2. ¬(P ∨ Q) = (¬P) ∧ (¬Q)\nFollow up: Can you provide an example of how these laws are applied?\nSo the final answer is: Using De Morgan’s Laws, ¬(P ∧ Q) transforms into (¬P) ∨ (¬Q), and ¬(P ∨ Q) transforms into (¬P) ∧ (¬Q)."}
{"input": "What is the duality principle in propositional logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Can you explain the duality principle?\nIntermediate answer: The duality principle in logic refers to the concept where you can transform logical expressions by switching conjunctions (∧) with disjunctions (∨), and universal sets with null sets. A formula's dual will always have the same truth value.\nFollow up: Can you provide an example of duality?\nSo the final answer is: For example, the dual of the expression (P ∧ Q) ∨ R is (P ∨ Q) ∧ R."}
{"input": "What is a propositional equivalence?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Can you define what makes two propositions equivalent?\nIntermediate answer: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value under every possible interpretation of their variables.\nFollow up: How do we prove that two propositions are equivalent?\nSo the final answer is: We can prove equivalence by either using truth tables or showing that the biconditional statement (P ⇔ Q) is a tautology."}
{"input": "What is the significance of normal forms in logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What are the two main types of normal forms?\nIntermediate answer: The two main types of normal forms in propositional logic are Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). CNF is a conjunction of disjunctions, while DNF is a disjunction of conjunctions.\nFollow up: Why is converting logical formulas into normal forms useful?\nSo the final answer is: Converting formulas into CNF or DNF makes them easier to analyze, particularly for algorithms in automated theorem proving and logic programming."}
{"input": "Can you explain the inverse of a conditional statement?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What is a conditional statement in logic?\nIntermediate answer: A conditional statement is of the form 'if P, then Q', written as P → Q. It asserts that Q is true whenever P is true.\nFollow up: What is the inverse of a conditional statement?\nSo the final answer is: The inverse of a conditional statement 'P → Q' is '¬P → ¬Q', meaning 'if not P, then not Q'."}
{"input": "What is a contradiction in propositional logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Can you define a contradiction?\nIntermediate answer: A contradiction is a formula that is always false, regardless of the truth values of its components. It can never be true.\nFollow up: How can we prove a formula is a contradiction?\nSo the final answer is: We can prove a contradiction by using a truth table to show that the formula evaluates to false for all possible truth assignments."}
{"input": "What are the limitations of propositional logic?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What are some limitations of propositional logic?\nIntermediate answer: Propositional logic has limitations such as the inability to represent relations like 'all', 'some', or 'none'. It cannot describe statements about properties or logical relationships.\nFollow up: Can you give examples of statements that propositional logic cannot express?\nSo the final answer is: Propositional logic cannot express statements like 'All vehicles have four wheels' or 'Some fruits are bitter'. These types of statements require predicate logic."}
{"input": "How does the converse of a conditional statement work?","output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What is the converse of a conditional statement?\nIntermediate answer: The converse of a conditional statement 'P → Q' is 'Q → P'. It switches the hypothesis and the conclusion.\nFollow up: Does the converse always hold true if the original conditional is true?\nSo the final answer is: No, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true even if the original statement is true. A counterexample can be used to show that the converse may not hold."}
