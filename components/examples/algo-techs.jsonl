{"input": "What is divide and conquer in algorithms?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How does the divide and conquer approach work?\nIntermediate answer: Divide and conquer breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them recursively, and then combines the results.\nFollow up: What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms?\nSo the final answer is: Examples of divide and conquer algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search, which break problems into smaller parts for efficient solutions."}
{"input": "What is a brute force algorithm?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: A brute force algorithm systematically tries all possible solutions to find the correct one. It is simple but inefficient for large problem sizes."}
{"input": "How does dynamic programming differ from recursion?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What is the main idea behind dynamic programming?\nIntermediate answer: Dynamic programming optimizes recursive problems by storing and reusing solutions to subproblems.\nFollow up: When should you use dynamic programming over recursion?\nSo the final answer is: Dynamic programming is used when overlapping subproblems exist, improving efficiency by avoiding redundant computations, unlike standard recursion."}
{"input": "What is a greedy algorithm?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It works well for problems like Huffman coding and Kruskal’s algorithm but may not always produce an optimal solution."}
{"input": "Explain the concept of backtracking in algorithms.", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How does backtracking solve problems?\nIntermediate answer: Backtracking explores all possible solutions by incrementally building and abandoning solutions when they fail constraints.\nFollow up: What are common problems solved using backtracking?\nSo the final answer is: Backtracking is used in problems like the N-Queens problem, Sudoku solving, and the Knight’s tour, where trial and error with constraints is necessary."}
{"input": "What is memoization in dynamic programming?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: Memoization is a technique in dynamic programming where previously computed results are stored and reused to avoid redundant calculations, improving efficiency."}
{"input": "How does the Knapsack problem relate to algorithm techniques?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What are the different approaches to solving the Knapsack problem?\nIntermediate answer: The Knapsack problem can be solved using brute force, dynamic programming, and greedy methods.\nFollow up: When is the greedy approach not optimal for the Knapsack problem?\nSo the final answer is: The greedy approach works for the Fractional Knapsack problem but fails for the 0/1 Knapsack problem, where dynamic programming provides the optimal solution."}
{"input": "What is the difference between BFS and DFS?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How do BFS and DFS traverse graphs?\nIntermediate answer: BFS explores all neighbors before going deeper, while DFS explores as deep as possible before backtracking.\nFollow up: When should BFS be preferred over DFS?\nSo the final answer is: BFS is preferred for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, while DFS is useful for cycle detection and topological sorting."}
{"input": "What is the time complexity of Bubble Sort?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n²) in the worst and average case, making it inefficient for large datasets."}
{"input": "How does topological sorting work?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: What types of graphs can be topologically sorted?\nIntermediate answer: Topological sorting applies to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where dependencies exist between nodes.\nFollow up: What algorithms can perform topological sorting?\nSo the final answer is: Topological sorting can be performed using Kahn’s algorithm (BFS-based) or DFS-based approaches to order tasks with dependencies."}
{"input": "What are heuristic algorithms?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: Heuristic algorithms are used for approximate solutions when exact solutions are too expensive to compute. Examples include A* search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms."}
{"input": "What is the Master Theorem?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How does the Master Theorem help in analyzing recursive algorithms?\nIntermediate answer: The Master Theorem provides a formula to determine the time complexity of divide and conquer recurrence relations.\nFollow up: What are the different cases in the Master Theorem?\nSo the final answer is: The Master Theorem categorizes recurrences into three cases based on the relationship between recursive calls and work done outside recursion, helping determine time complexity efficiently."}
{"input": "What is the difference between polynomial and exponential time complexity?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: No.\nSo the final answer is: Polynomial time complexity (O(n^k)) grows at a reasonable rate, while exponential time (O(2^n)) grows much faster, making algorithms with exponential complexity impractical for large inputs."}
{"input": "What is amortized analysis in algorithms?", "output": "Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How does amortized analysis differ from worst-case analysis?\nIntermediate answer: Amortized analysis provides an average time per operation over a sequence of operations, rather than the worst-case for a single operation.\nFollow up: What are common examples where amortized analysis is useful?\nSo the final answer is: Amortized analysis is useful in scenarios like dynamic array resizing and the union-find data structure, where occasional expensive operations are balanced by many cheap ones."}
